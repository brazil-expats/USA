# USA

## Tips after entering the country for the first time
- Get your SSN on the first day

- Get a pre-paid T-Mobile SIM card
- One week before travelling, go to [StreetEasy](https://streeteasy.com) or [NakedApartment](https://www.nakedapartments.com/) and schedule some visits
- Most apartments are freed on the 1st and 15th of the month
- There are a lot of Brazilians in the US. If anything goes wrong, aks for help
